# Intermediate Coding - Lesson 5 - Loops

## Step 1 @unplugged
**Loops** are used in computer programs to perform the **same operation multiple times**.

Looping can also be known as **iteration**.

Can you think of a time when you had to repeat the same process over and over multiple times? Even something you only had to do exactly the same twice rather than hundreds of times?

- What about walking down the street - you repeat the same process of moving one foot, then move the other and repeat
- What about the process you do every morning to get to school - get out of bed, get dressed, have breakfast, pack your school bag, travel to school 
- What about using building blocks or modelling clay to create a street of identical houses?

What if you could do these processes once and then automatically repeat exactly the same steps to reproduce as many times as you wish?

In MakeCode we have a number of different types of Loop blocks which can be used to repeat a series of blocks multiple times.

Some loops are very similar and the same result could be reached by using differing types of loops.


## Step 2 @unplugged
Loops can be found in the ``||LOOPS:LOOPS||`` drawer in MakeCode.

## Step 3 @unplugged
REPEAT loops

**Repeat** loops will repeat a number of blocks a specified number of times.

It takes a number variable to determine the number of times the blocks of code will run. The number can be a fixed number or a variable. This number is referred to as the loop control variable as it controls the number of times the loop will run.

Any blocks placed inside the repeat loop block will be run, one after the other, the number of times specified in the loop control variable.

## Step 4 @unplugged
While loops

**While** loops will repeat a number of blocks whilst a condition is true.

It takes a boolean variable to determine if the blocks of code will run.

By default the boolean true value is used which means the loop will run forever. You would typically change this loop control variable to be a boolean variable which you change in your loop when you want it to stop looping.

Any blocks placed inside the while loop block will be run, one after the other until the loop control variable is false. 

Note: the blocks in the while loop may never run if the loop control is false to begin with!

## Step 5 @unplugged
While loops

In the below example a while loop has been used to continue ot move the agent one block formward and place a block behind them whilst the agent has blocks in slot 1 of its inventory.

## Step 6 @unplugged
For loops

**For** loops will repeat a number of blocks depending on the value of the loop control variable.

Each time the loop enumerates the loop control variable (named index by default) is automatically incremented by 1.

By default the loop will enumerate 5 times as the loop control variable (named index by default) is first 0, then 1, then 2, then 3, then 4. When the variable is greater than 4 the loop no longer runs.

You can change the loop control variable to be a variable of your choice by clicking the down arrow.

You can also access the value of loop control variable inside the loop.

For loops are typically used with **arrays**.

Any blocks placed inside the for loop block will be run, one after the other until the loop control variable reaches it maximum value.
