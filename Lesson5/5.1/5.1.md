# Intermediate Coding - Lesson 5.1 - Loops - Using REPEAT loops
### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
**REPEAT** loops are one of the many methods we can use to run a series of blocks multiple times.

## Step 2 @unplugged
**Creating a REPEAT loop**

The ``||LOOPS:repeat 4 times||`` block can be found in the ``||LOOPS:LOOPS||`` drawer in MakeCode.

## Step 3 @unplugged
**Creating a REPEAT loop**

Repeat loops use a numeric loop control variable to determine the number of times the blocks within the repeat loop will run. 

This is the number 4 by default which means if you do not change this the blocks within the repeat loop will run one after the other 4 times.

## Step 4 @unplugged
**Creating a REPEAT loop**

You can change this to be a number variable you have already created.

## Step 5 @unplugged
**REPEAT loop example**

In this example a REPEAT loop is used to run the same blocks multiple times. 

Before the repeat loop the loop control variable lengthOfWall is set to the number 8.

The 2 blocks inside the repeat block will run 8 times therefore the agent will move forward by 1 then place a block behind them 8 times.

Using repeat loops we can perform repetitive actions very easily.

## Step 6 @unplugged
**REPEAT loop example**

If we wanted to make a longer or shorter wall we would just need to change the value of the lengthOfWall variable. 

We could change this by passing a variable into the chat command as shown below. This would allow us to create walls of any length from just chat commands in our game!
