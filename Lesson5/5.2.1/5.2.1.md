# Intermediate Coding - Lesson 5.2.1 - Loops - Using WHILE loops activity
### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
In this activity we will use ``||LOOPS:while true||`` loop blocks to add some functionality to our Minecraft game.

In this program we will program our agent to mine blocks in front of it while we detect a certain type of block.

## Step 2
From the ``||PLAYER:PLAYER||`` drawer drag out an ``||PLAYER:on chat command||`` event block and set it to respond to the command **mine**.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks
player.onChat("mine",function () {
 
})

```
## Step 3
From the ``||LOOPS:LOOPS||`` drawer place a ``||LOOPS:while false do||`` block inside the ``||PLAYER:on chat command||`` block and change false to true.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("mine",function () {
	while (true) {
    	
    }
})

```

## Step 4
From the ``||LOGIC:LOGIC||`` drawer place a ``||LOGIC: 0 = 0||`` block in the condition for the while loop.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("mine",function () {
	while (0 == 0) {
    	
    }
})

```

## Step 5
From the ``||AGENT:AGENT||`` drawer place an ``||AGENT:inspect block forward ||`` block on the first 0 of the 0 = 0 block.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("mine",function () {
	while (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block, FORWARD) == 0) {
    	
    }
})

```

## Step 6
From the ``||BLOCKS:BLOCKS||`` drawer place a ``||BLOCKS:block||`` block on the second 0 of the 0 = 0 block and change it to the brick block.

This has now changed the condition in the while loop to loop while the block in front of the agent is a brick block.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("mine",function () {
	while (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block, FORWARD) == BRICKS) {
    	
    }
})

```

## Step 7
Inside the while loop place an ``||AGENT:agent destroy forward||`` and an ``||AGENT:agent move forward by 1||`` block.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("mine",function () {
	while (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block, FORWARD) == BRICKS) {
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)    	
    }
})

```

## Step 9 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step, click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game and ensure you are on the ground and not flying.

2. Notice that there are gold ore blocks at various places, at which point our agent should stop mining when reaching them.

3. Run the chat command **mine** and observe your agent destroy all the brick blocks but not the gold ore blocks.

## Step 10
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.
