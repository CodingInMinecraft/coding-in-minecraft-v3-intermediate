# Intermediate Coding - Lesson 5.2 - Loops - Using WHILE loops

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
**WHILE** loops are another method we can use to run a series of blocks multiple times.

## Step 2 @unplugged
**Creating a WHILE loop**

``||LOOPS:while true||`` loop blocks can be found in the ``||LOOPS:LOOPS||`` drawer in MakeCode.

## Step 3 @unplugged
**Creating a WHILE loop**

While loops will repeat a number of blocks whilst a condition is true.

While loops take a boolean variable to determine if the blocks of code will run. If this boolean is false to begin with the blocks will never run.

By default the boolean true value is used which means the loop will run forever. 

You would typically change this loop control variable to be a boolean variable which you change in your loop when you want it to stop looping.

Any blocks placed inside the ``||LOOPS:while true||`` loop block will be run, one after the other until the loop control variable is false.

## Step 4 @unplugged
**WHILE loop example**

In this example a ``||LOOPS:while true||`` loop block is used to run the same blocks multiple times.

When the "build" command is run the agent will move forward by one block and lay a block from the 1st slot of the agents inventory whilst the agent has inventory in slot 1.

The 2 blocks inside the ``||LOOPS:while true||`` loop block will run continuously until the agent has no blocks in slot 1.

Using repeat loops we can perform repetitive actions very easily.
