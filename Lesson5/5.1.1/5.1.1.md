# Intermediate Coding - 5.1.1 - Loops - Using REPEAT loops activity

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
In this activity we will use REPEAT Loop blocks to add some functionality to our Minecraft game.

In this program we will program our agent to build a animal pen.

## Step 2
From the ``||PLAYER:PLAYER||`` drawer drag out an ``||PLAYER:on chat command||`` event block and change this to respond to the command **buildPen**.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks
player.onChat("buildPen",function () {
 
})
)
```
## Step 3
From the ``||AGENT:AGENT||`` drawer place an ``||AGENT:agent place on move off||`` block in the ``||PLAYER:on chat command||``  block and change the boolean to ``||LOGIC:on||`` 

This will cause the agent to lay a block when it moves.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("buildPen", function () {
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
})
```

## Step 4
From the ``||LOOPS:LOOPS||`` drawers place a ``||LOOPS:repeat 4 times||`` block after the ``||AGENT:agent place on move on||`` block.


#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("buildPen", function () {
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
	for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
    	
    }
})
```

## Step 5
Place an ``||AGENT:agent move forward by 1||`` block inside the ``||LOOPS:repeat 4 times||`` loop.

This should make the agent move forward by 4 blocks. As we have set the agent place on move to on, the agent will lay a block when they move.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("buildPen", function () {
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
	for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
		agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    }
})
```

## Step 6
Next let's test the code.

## Step 7 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step, click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

4. Drag the fence blocks in your inventory to the agents first inventory position.
This equips your agent with the fence blocks.

5. Open the chat window and run the command **buildPen**.
Notice how the agent places 4 fence blocks.

## Step 8
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.
