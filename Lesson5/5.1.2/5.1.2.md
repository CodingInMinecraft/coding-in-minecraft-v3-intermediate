## Step 1 @unplugged
Now the agent can build one fence lets extend our code so the agent can build a square pen made of the fence blocks.

To do this we will repeat this process 4 times:
- move our agent 4 blocks
- turn the agent left

## Step 2
Change the number variable in the agent move forward by 1 block to 4.

From the ``||AGENT:AGENT||`` drawer place and ``||AGENT: agent turn left||`` block after the  ``||AGENT: agent move forward by 4||`` block

```template
player.onChat("buildPen", function () {
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
	for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
		agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    }
})
```
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks
player.onChat("buildPen", function () {
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
	for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
        agent.move(FORWARD, 4)
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    }
})

```
## Step 3
Finally, if you test your code now you may notice the agent cannot complete the pen as when it tries to place the last block it cannot move forward as there is a block in the way.

To fix this adjust the loop to run 3 times to build 3 of the walls then place an ``||AGENT: agent move forward by 3||`` block after the loop and an ``||AGENT: agent move left by 1||`` block. This will cause the agent to build the 4th wall.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks
player.onChat("buildPen", function () {
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, true)
	for (let index = 0; index < 3; index++) {
		agent.move(FORWARD, 4)
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    }
	agent.move(FORWARD, 3)
    agent.move(LEFT, 1)
})
```

## Step 4
Next lets test the code.

## Step 5 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. When back in the game open the **chat window** by pressing the t key on the keyboard or tapping the chat icon.
3. Enter the text **buildPen** and press **Enter**.
4. Notice how the agent places 4 fence blocks, turns left, places another 4 fence blocks, turns left again, places another 4 fence blocks, turns left (this is all the actions performed in the loop). The agent then moves forward 3 blocks and places blocks then moves left and places a block to finish the fence.

## Step 6
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.

## Step 7 @tutorialCompleted
Return to the game and move onto the next non player character
