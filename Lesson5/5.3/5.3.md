# Intermediate Coding - Lesson 5.3 - Loops - Using FOR loops

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
**FOR** loops are another method we can use to run a series of blocks multiple times.

## Step 2 @unplugged
**Creating a FOR loop**

``||LOOPS:for index from 0 to 4||`` blocks can be found in the ``||LOOPS:LOOPS||`` drawer in MakeCode.

## Step 3 @unplugged
**Creating a FOR loop**

**FOR** loops will repeat a number of blocks depending on the value of the loop control variable.

Each time the loop enumerates the loop control variable (named index by default) is automatically incremented by 1.

By default the loop will enumerate 5 times as the loop control variable (named index by default) is first 0, then 1, then 2, then 3, then 4. When the variable is greater than 4 the loop no longer runs.

You can change the loop control variable to be a variable of your choice by clicking the down arrow.

You can also access the value of loop control variable inside the loop.

Any blocks placed inside the for loop block will be run, one after the other until the loop control variable reaches it maximum value.

## Step 4
**FOR loop example**

In this example, a **FOR** loop is used to run the same blocks multiple times.

When the "count" command is run the loop will enumerate 5 times.

If you run the code notice in the chat window 5 messages appear detailing the value of the loop control variable (index) each time the loop enumerates.

The loop enumerates 5 times as the first time the loop runs the value of index is 0, the second time it is 1, third time 2, fourth time 3 and finally the fifth time 4.

Notice it is automatically increased by one each time the loop enumerates.

Change the value of the loop control variable from 4 to another number and run the count command again to observe the difference. 

You should notice a different number of message appear - 1 more than the value you entered.

```template
player.onChat("count", function () {
    for (let index = 0; index <= 4; index++) {
        player.say("Value of the loop control variable is: " + index)
    }
})
```
