# Intermediate Coding - Lesson 4 - Advanced Logic - IF THEN ELSE Statements
### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
We have already learned that **Logic** is used in computer programs when you need to make a decision and possibly take one of many paths based on the decision.

We have already explored the ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` block on Lesson 3 to allow us to run some code should a condition be met but sometimes things may be more complex - you may want to take a different path based on the value of the variable or the logic may be more complex than simply using a comparison operator to compare 1 variable value.

In MakeCode we have ``||LOGIC:IF THEN ELSE||`` block which we can use to make a choice between multiple code pathways depending on a condition.

## Step 2 @unplugged
IF THEN ELSE statements

The standard ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` block allows you to run some code should a condition exist.

This block can be expanded to an ``||LOGIC:IF THEN ELSE||`` block which allows you to run some code should a condition exist or run some other code should the condition not exist. It allows a choice of 2 paths should a condition exist or not.

For example the below flow chart can be used to visualise that different actions are performed based on if a condition is met (i.e. is true) or not met (i.e. is false)

The condition in this statement is **IF WEATHER IS NICE**. If this statement is **TRUE (yes it is nice weather)** we take one action (Play outside) and if it is **FALSE** we take another action (Play inside).

## Step 3 @unplugged
``||LOGIC:IF THEN ELSE||`` Blocks in MakeCode

Any ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` block can be converted to an ``||LOGIC:IF THEN ELSE||`` block in MakeCode by clicking + symbol at the bottom of the ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` block.

## Step 4 @unplugged
``||LOGIC:IF THEN ELSE||`` Blocks in MakeCode

Alternatively an ``||LOGIC:IF THEN ELSE||`` block can be found in the Logic drawer.

## Step 5 @unplugged
``||LOGIC:IF THEN ELSE||`` Blocks in MakeCode

The blocks you place inside the **IF** part of block will only run if the condition evaluates to **TRUE**.

The blocks you place in the **ELSE** part of the block will only run if the condition evaluates to **FALSE**.

In this example if the agent detects a block in front of it it will destroy the block then move forward by 1 if there is no block in front of it it will just move forward by 1.

## Step 6 @unplugged
``||LOGIC:IF THEN ELSE IF ELSE||`` Blocks in MakeCode

Sometimes there may be more than 2 pathways to choose between. This is where the ``||LOGIC:IF THEN ELSE IF ELSE||`` block can be used.

It allows you to make a choice based on various comparison operators.

For example if your age is 11 or under you are in primary school else if your age is under 16 then you are in secondary school otherwise you may be finished school.

An ``||LOGIC:IF THEN ELSE IF ELSE||`` block can be created from any ``||LOGIC:IF THEN ELSE||`` block by clicking the + symbol.

## Step 7 @unplugged
``||LOGIC:IF THEN ELSE IF ELSE||`` Blocks in MakeCode

The condition in the first if statement will be evaluated and if true the blocks inside that part of the statement will run.

If it is false the condition in the else if part of the statement will be evaluated and if it is true the blocks inside this part of the statement will run.

If this condition is false the blocks in the else part will run.

Once all the blocks in any of the sections run the next block after the ``||LOGIC:IF THEN ELSE IF ELSE||`` block will run.

## Step 8 @unplugged
``||LOGIC:IF THEN ELSE IF ELSE||`` Blocks in MakeCode

In this example we have used and IF THEN ELSE IF ELSE statement to check firstly if the value of the playerAge variable is less than or equal to 11, if so a message stating You are probably in Primary School is displayed. If the variable is greater than 11 the condition in the ELSE IF statement is evaluated which checks if the variable is less than or equal to 16 and if so a message stating You are probably in Secondary School is displayed and this evaluates to false the blocks in the else part of the statement will run displaying a different message.

This could be represented as the below flow chart.
