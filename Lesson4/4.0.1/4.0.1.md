## Step 1 @unplugged

Sometimes decisions are not as simple as being based on one variables value.

Sometimes you may need to take a certain path based on the comparison of 2 variables and only if these 2 comparisons are both true then take that path.

We can expand the condition in an IF statement to use a **Boolean operator** to expand the condition of the IF statement to be based on 2 comparisons.

We can use Boolean operators in MakeCode to expand the condition of an if statement to be based on multiple comparisons.

## Step 2 @unplugged
**Boolean Operators**

The Boolean operator blocks in MakeCode can be found in the ``||LOGIC:LOGIC||`` drawer.

The Boolean operator blocks have pointed ends which indicate this will give a Boolean when evaluated.

There are 3 Boolean operators:
- AND
- OR
- NOT

## Step 3 @unplugged
**Boolean Operator - AND**

Each side of the **AND** operator is a separate expression to be evaluated.

The gaps on either side of the and word are expecting blocks which evaluate to a Boolean.

The AND operator takes each evaluated expression and if each results in **TRUE**, then the overall result of the AND Boolean operator is **TRUE**.

If either of the evaluated expressions results in **FALSE**, then the overall result of the AND Boolean operator is **FALSE**.

This block is very useful when you want some blocks of code to run only when **ALL** conditions are true.

**The rule of thumb for AND Boolean logic is that the result will be TRUE if ALL components of the AND operation are TRUE otherwise the result will be FALSE.**

## Step 4 @unplugged
**Boolean Operator - OR**

Each side of the **OR** operator is a separate expression to be evaluated.

The gaps on either side of the or word are expecting blocks which evaluate to a Boolean.

The OR operator takes each evaluated expression and if ANY results in **TRUE** then the overall result of the OR Boolean operator is **TRUE**.

If ALL of the evaluated expressions results in **FALSE** then the overall result of the OR Boolean operator is **FALSE**.

This block is very useful when you want some blocks of code to run when **at least 1** of the conditions are true.

**The rule of thumb for OR Boolean logic is that the result will be FALSE if all components of the OR operation are FALSE otherwise the result will be TRUE.**

## Step 5 @unplugged
**Boolean Operator - NOT**

We can use this operator to reverse the Boolean result, i.e. change true to false and vice versa.

In the code snippet shown, we have used this block so that if the agents does not detect a block in front of it (i.e. agent detect block forward returns false) then the agent will move forward by 1).
