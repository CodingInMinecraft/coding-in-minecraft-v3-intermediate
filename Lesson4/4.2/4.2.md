# Intermediate Coding - Lesson 4.2 - Advanced Logic - Using Boolean Operators


### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
Boolean operators allow you to create more complex comparisons.

You may need to take a certain path based on the comparison of 2 variables and only if these 2 comparisons are both true then take that path.

There are 3 types of Boolean operators:
- **AND** - both sides of the operator must evaluate to TRUE for the overall combined result to be TRUE
- **OR** - if any side of the operator evaluates to TRUE the overall combined result will be TRUE
- **NOT** - reverses a boolean

They are typically used as conditions in ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` blocks and are also commonly used in loops which we will look at later.

## Step 2 @unplugged
**Using Boolean Operators in an IF THEN Statement**

Boolean Operator blocks can be found in the ``||LOGIC:LOGIC||`` drawer.

## Step 3 @unplugged
**Using Boolean Operators in an IF THEN Statement**

The Boolean operator block has pointed ends indicating that it results in a Boolean value of either true or false, so it can be used wherever a Boolean block is used such as in ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` blocks or loops.

## Step 4 @unplugged
**Using Boolean Operators in an IF THEN Statement**

Each side of the Boolean operator also has pointed ends, therefore, we need to place blocks which result in Boolean value.

In this example, we have used an agent detect block forward block and a Boolean = block to check if the player's name is Peter.

As this is an **AND** Boolean operator, if both conditions are true the blocks inside the if statement will run. If any of the conditions are false, the blocks will not run.

## Step 5 @unplugged
**Using Boolean Operators in an IF THEN Statement**

The example has now been expanded to include an **OR** Boolean operator.

Now in the ELSE IF section of the IF block we are checking if the block in front of the agent is a Grass or Dirt block and if so run the Agent destroy forward block.

## Step 6 @unplugged
**Using Boolean Operators in an IF THEN Statement**

Finally the example, has been expanded to include a **NOT** Boolean operator.

In the final ELSE IF section of the IF block we are reversing the result of the Agent detect forward block. 
If this block is true it means a block is in front of us and if it is false it means there is not a block in front of us.

In this example, we want to run the Agent move forward by 1 block when there is no block in front of us. This will be the case when the Agent detect forward block is false. 

Therefore, we can use a **NOT** Boolean operator to reverse the condition.

Therefore, the ELSE IF statement is asking if there is not a block in front of the agent.
