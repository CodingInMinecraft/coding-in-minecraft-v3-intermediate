# Intermediate Coding - Lesson 4.1 - Advanced Logic - Using IF THEN ELSE Statements


### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
``||LOGIC:IF THEN ELSE||`` blocks are an extension of ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` block used to perform logic in MakeCode.

Using the ``||LOGIC:IF THEN ELSE||`` block we can provide additional logic.

## Step 2 @unplugged
**Creating an IF THEN, ELSE Statement**

``||LOGIC:IF THEN ELSE||`` blocks can be found in the ``||LOGIC:LOGIC||`` drawer in MakeCode.

## Step 3 @unplugged
**Creating an IF THEN, ELSE Statement**

Any ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` block can be expanded to an ``||LOGIC:IF THEN ELSE||`` block by clicking the + symbol on the block.

## Step 4 @unplugged
**Creating an IF THEN, ELSE Statement**

Just like ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` blocks the ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` part of ``||LOGIC:IF THEN ELSE||`` block evaluates an expression. If it evaluates to **TRUE** the blocks in the ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` section will run and if it evaluates to **FALSE** the blocks in the ``||LOGIC:ELSE||`` section will run.

When you use an ``||LOGIC:IF THEN ELSE||`` block you need to replace the default true Boolean block between the if and then with any block which evaluates to a **Boolean**.

If you leave the default true block, any blocks you place inside the if then block will always run rather than only run if a condition is met.

## Step 5 @unplugged
**Example**

In this example, an ``||LOGIC:IF THEN ELSE||`` block is used to check the time of day it is in the game. If it is night time (13000 ticks), the player will be teleported to the center of the word and a message appears saying it's night time. If it is day time a message stating so is displayed.
