# Intermediate Coding - Lesson 4.2.2 - Advanced Logic - Boolean Operators Activity

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1
Now let's expand our code to add in other ages as well.

Add an ELSE IF to your ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||``  block by clicking the + symbol.

```template
player.onChat("age", function (age) {
    if (age >= 0 && age <= 3) {
        player.say("You are a baby!")   	
    } else {
    	
    }
})
```

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("age", function (age) {
    if (age >= 0 && age <= 3) {
        player.say("You are a baby!")
    } else if (false) {
    	
    } else {
    	
    }
})
```

## Step 2
From the ``||LOGIC:LOGIC||`` drawer place a Boolean ``||LOGIC:AND||`` operator block into the ELSE IF condition.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("age", function (age) {
    if (age >= 0 && age <= 3) {
        player.say("You are a baby!")
    } else if (false && false) {
    	
    } else {
    	
    }
})
```

## Step 3
From the ``||LOGIC:LOGIC||`` drawer place a comparison operator in each side of the Boolean ``||LOGIC:AND||`` operator.

Change the first comparison operator to greater than and the second comparison operator to less than or equal to.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("age", function (age) {
    if (age >= 0 && age <= 3) {
        player.say("You are a baby!")
    } else if (0 > 0 && 0 <= 0) {
    	
    } else {
    	
    }
})
```

## Step 4
Place a ``||VARIABLES: age||`` block in the first part of each of the 2 comparison operators and and in the second part of the first comparison block change the value to 3. In the second comparison block change the value to 12.


#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("age", function (age) {
    if (age >= 0 && age <= 3) {
        player.say("You are a baby!")
    } else if (age > 3 && age <= 12) {
    	
    } else {
    	
    }
})
```

## Step 5
Add a ``||PLAYER:say ":)"||`` block to the ELSE IF statement and change the text to be "You are a kid!"
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("age", function (age) {
    if (age >= 0 && age <= 3) {
        player.say("You are a baby!")
    } else if (age > 3 && age <= 12) {
        player.say("You are a kid!")
    } else {
    	
    }
})
```

## Step 6
Add a further ELSE IF section to the block by clicking the + symbol.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("age", function (age) {
    if (age >= 0 && age <= 3) {
        player.say("You are a baby!")
    } else if (age > 3 && age <= 12) {
        player.say("You are a kid!")
    } else if (false) {
    	
    } else {
    	
    }
})
```

## Step 7
As before add a Boolean ``||LOGIC:AND||`` comparison block and 2 comparison blocks (one greater than and one less than or equal to) to check the age is between the values 12 and 18 and if so display the message "You are a teenager!"
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("age", function (age) {
    if (age >= 0 && age <= 3) {
        player.say("You are a baby!")
    } else if (age > 3 && age <= 12) {
        player.say("You are a kid!")
    } else if (age > 12 && age <= 18) {
        player.say("You are a teenager!")
    } else {
    	
    }
})
```

## Step 8
Finally, place a ``||PLAYER:say ":)"||`` block in the ELSE part of the IF block.

The ELSE part of the IF block will run if none of the other parts run.

In our example, if they are not a baby, kid, or teenager then they must be an adult. Therefore, change the text of the block to "You are an adult!"
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("age", function (age) {
    if (age >= 0 && age <= 3) {
        player.say("You are a baby!")
    } else if (age > 3 && age <= 12) {
        player.say("You are a kid!")
    } else if (age > 12 && age <= 18) {
        player.say("You are a teenager!")
    } else {
        player.say("You are an adult!")
    }
})

```
## Step 9
Next let's test the code.

Click Next for instructions on how to test your code.

## Step 10 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step, click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

## Step 11
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.

## Step 12 @tutorialCompleted
Return to the game and move onto the next non-player character.
