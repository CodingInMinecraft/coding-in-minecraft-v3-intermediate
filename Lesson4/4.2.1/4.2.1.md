# Intermediate Coding - Lesson 4.2.1 - Advanced Logic - Boolean Operators Activity

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
In this activity, we will use Boolean operators to enhance the functionality of IF THEN blocks.

We will create a program which will use an IF THEN, ELSE statement and some Boolean operators to check the age of the player. 
In this program, we will create a variable called age that the player will test in the chat command. 



## Step 2
From the ``||PLAYER:PLAYER||`` drawer drag out an ``||PLAYER:on chat command||`` event block and set it to respond to the command **age**.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks
player.onChat("age",function () {
 
})

```
## Step 3
Click on the + symbol to the right of the ``||PLAYER:on chat command "age"||`` block.

This will add a variable called **num1**. 
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("age",function (num1) {
	
})

```

## Step 4
We would normally rename the variable to reflect what it is representing in the code (age), however, due to an issue in MakeCode, we will be using the default num1. 

Open the variable drawer and create a variable named num1. 
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("age",function (num1) {
	
})

```
## Step 5
From the ``||LOGIC:LOGIC||`` drawer drag out an ``||LOGIC:IF THEN ELSE||`` block and place it inside the ``||PLAYER:on chat command "age"||`` block.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("age", function (num1) {
    if (true) {
    	
    } else {
    	
    }
})

```

## Step 6
Replace the default true block with a Boolean ``||LOGIC:AND||`` block from the ``||LOGIC:LOGIC||`` drawer.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("age", function (num1) {
    if (false && false) {
    	
    } else {
    	
    }
})


```

## Step 7
From the Logic drawer, place a ``||LOGIC: 0 = 0 ||`` comparison block in the first part of the Boolean and block and change its comparison operator to the greater than or equal to operator.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("age", function (num1) {
    if (0 >= 0 && false) {
    	
    } else {
    	
    }
})
```

## Step 8
From the ``||VARIABLE: VARIABLE||`` drawer place the ``||VARIABLES:num1||`` block in the first comparison block of the greater than or equal to comparison operator block.


#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("age", function (num1) {
    if (num1 >= 0 && false) {
    	
    } else {
    	
    }
})
```
## Step 9
From the ``||LOGIC:LOGIC||`` drawer place a ``||LOGIC: 0 = 0 ||``comparison block in the second part of the Boolean and block and change its comparison operator to the less than or equal to operator.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("age", function (num1) {
    if (num1 >= 0 && 0 <= 0) {
    	
    } else {
    	
    }
})
```

## Step 10
As before, from the ``||VARIABLE: VARIABLE||`` drawer place a ``||VARIABLES: num1||`` block in the first comparison block of the less than or equal to comparison operator block.

Change the numeric value in the second comparison block to 3.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("age", function (num1) {
    if (num1 >= 0 && num1 <= 3) {
    	
    } else {
    	
    }
})
```

## Step 11
From the ``||PLAYER:PLAYER||`` drawer place a ``||PLAYER:say ":)"||`` block inside the IF block and change the text to "You are a baby!".

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("age", function (num1) {
    if (num1 >= 0 && num1 <= 3) {
        player.say("You are a baby!")
    } else {
    	
    }
})
```
## Step 12
Next let's test the code.
