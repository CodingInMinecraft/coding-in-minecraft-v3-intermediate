## Step 1 @unplugged
In **MakeCode** we have ``||LOGIC:LOGIC||`` blocks can be used to either make a choice between 2 paths or more complex decisions involving many pathways (or decision options)

When making choices we often need to compare two items, for example you may want the route you take to school to be the shortest route in which case you would compare the distance a number of routes, in MakeCode we have a number of Comparison blocks which allow us to compare 2 variables and are typically used in decision making in Logic blocks.

## Step 2 @unplugged
IF THEN statements

The most basic form of decision making in MakeCode is the ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` block.

This block allows you to make a decision whether to perform an action based on a condition.

For example the below flow chart can be used to visualise a choice that if a condition is met an action is performed.

The condition in this statement is IF ITS COLD OUTSIDE. If this statement is TRUE (yes it is cold outside) we can take an action - if its cold outside then you will wear a jacket.

This is a simple IF THEN statement.

## Step 3 @unplugged
``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` Blocks in MakeCode

The ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` block can be found in the ``||LOGIC:LOGIC||`` drawer

![alt text](https://intermediatev3.codingcredentials.com/Lesson3/3/images/2.jpg?raw=true "IF THEN")

The blocks you place inside the ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` block will only run if the condition evaluates to **TRUE**.

The default condition in the ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` block is the boolean condition **true** which means that the blocks inside the ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` block will always run.

In this example the agent destroy forward block will only run if the condition in the if statement is true (which it will always be)

## Step 4 @unplugged
Comparison Operators

We can use **comparison operators** in MakeCode to provide the logic functionality in the **condition** of an ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||``  block.

Using these operators we can then determine should some blocks of code run or not.

When a comparison block is evaluated it results in a **boolean**.

A **boolean** is either **true** or **false**.

When the comparison block evaluates to true the blocks in the ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||``  block run.

The **comparison blocks** in MakeCode can be found in the Logic drawer

## Step 5 @unplugged
Comparison Operators

The comparison block have **pointed ends** which indicate this will give a **boolean** when evaluated.

The block compares 2 variables using a comparison operator.

There are 6 comparison operators:

- = (equal to)
- ≠ (not equal to)
- < (Less than)
- ≤ (less than or equal to)
- `>` (greater than)
- ≥ (greater than or equal to)

The comparison operator can be changed by clicking the down arrow beside the operator in the comparison block.

## Step 6 @unplugged
= (equal to) operator

We can use this operator to check 2 variables are the same value and if they are the expression will evaluate to true, if not it will evaluate to false.

The two default variables are 0 (zero) and 0 (zero) this means that if you do not change them the block will evaluate to true.

## Step 7 @unplugged
≠ (not equal to) operator

We can use this operator to check 2 variables are not the same value and if they are not the same value the expression will evaluate to true, if they are the same it will evaluate to false.

![alt text](https://intermediatev3.codingcredentials.com/Lesson3/3/images/7.png?raw=true "NotEqualTo")

## Step 8 @unplugged
< (less than) operator

We can use this operator to check that the value of the 1st variable is less than the 2nd variable. If the value of the 1st variable is less than the second variable it will evaluate to true, if the value of the first variable is equal to or  greater than the second variable it will evaluate to false.

![alt text](https://intermediatev3.codingcredentials.com/Lesson3/3/images/8.png?raw=true "LessThan")

## Step 9 @unplugged
≤ (less than or equal to)

This operator is similar to the less than operator with a small difference - if the value of the 2 variables is the same it will also evaluate to true.

![alt text](https://intermediatev3.codingcredentials.com/Lesson3/3/images/9.png?raw=true "LessThan")

## Step 10 @unplugged
`>` (greater than) operator

We can use this operator to check that the value of the 1st variable is greater than the 2nd variable. If the value of the 1st variable is greater than the second variable it will evaluate to true, if the value of the first variable is equal  to or less than the second variable it will evaluate to false.

![alt text](https://intermediatev3.codingcredentials.com/Lesson3/3/images/10.png?raw=true "LessThan")

## Step 11 @unplugged
≥ (greater than or equal to) operator

This operator is similar to the greater than operator with a small difference - if the value of the 2 variables is the same it will also evaluate to true.
