## Step 1 @unplugged
In **MakeCode** we have ``||LOGIC:LOGIC||`` blocks can be used to either make a choice between 2 paths or more complex decisions involving many pathways (or decision options).

When making choices we often need to compare two items. For example, you may want the route you take to school to be the shortest route. In this case you would compare the distance a number of routes. In MakeCode we have a number of Comparison blocks which allow us to compare 2 variables and are typically used in decision making in Logic blocks.

## Step 2 @unplugged
**IF THEN statements**

The most basic form of decision making in MakeCode is the ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` block.

This block allows you to make a decision whether to perform an action based on a condition.

For example the below flow chart can be used to visualise a choice that if a condition is met an action is performed.

The condition in this statement is IF IT'S COLD OUTSIDE. If this statement is TRUE (yes it is cold outside) we can take an action - if it's cold outside then you will wear a jacket.

This is a simple IF THEN statement.

## Step 3 @unplugged
``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` Blocks in MakeCode

The ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` block can be found in the ``||LOGIC:LOGIC||`` drawer.

![alt text](https://intermediatev3.codingcredentials.com/Lesson3/3/images/2.jpg?raw=true "IF THEN")

The blocks you place inside the ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` block will only run if the condition evaluates to **TRUE**.

The default condition in the ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` block is the Boolean condition **true** which means that the blocks inside the ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` block will always run.

In this example the agent destroy forward block will only run if the condition in the if statement is true (which it will always be).

## Step 4 @unplugged
**Comparison Operators**

We can use **comparison operators** in MakeCode to provide the logic functionality in the **condition** of an ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||``  block.

Using these operators, we can then determine should some blocks of code run or not.

When a comparison block is evaluated it results in a **Boolean**.

A **Boolean** is either **true** or **false**.

When the comparison block evaluates to true, the blocks in the ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||``  block run.

The **comparison blocks** in MakeCode can be found in the Logic drawer.

## Step 5 @unplugged
**Comparison Operators**

The comparison block have **pointed ends** which indicate this will give a **Boolean** when evaluated.

The block compares 2 variables using a comparison operator.

There are 6 comparison operators:

- = (equal to)
- ≠ (not equal to)
- < (Less than)
- ≤ (less than or equal to)
- `>` (greater than)
- ≥ (greater than or equal to)

The comparison operator can be changed by clicking the down arrow beside the operator in the comparison block.

## Step 6 @unplugged
**Equal To Operator**
The symbol is the = sign.

We can use this operator to check if 2 variables are the same value. If they are the same value, the expression will evaluate to true. If not, it will evaluate to false.

The two default variables are 0 (zero) and 0 (zero). This means that if you do not change them the block will evaluate to true.

## Step 7 @unplugged
** Not Equal To Operator**
The symbol is the ≠ sign.

We can use this operator to check if 2 variables are not the same value. If they are not the same value, the expression will evaluate to true. If they are the same it will evaluate to false.

![alt text](https://intermediatev3.codingcredentials.com/Lesson3/3/images/7.png?raw=true "NotEqualTo")

## Step 8 @unplugged
** Less Than Operator**
The symbol is the < sign.

We can use this operator to check that the value of the 1st variable is less than the 2nd variable. If the value of the 1st variable is less than the second variable, it will evaluate to true.
If the value of the first variable is equal to or greater than, the second variable it will evaluate to false.

![alt text](https://intermediatev3.codingcredentials.com/Lesson3/3/images/8.png?raw=true "LessThan")

## Step 9 @unplugged
** Less Than or Equal To Operator**
The symbol is the ≤ sign. 

We can use this operator to check that the value of the 1st variable is less than or equal to the 2nd variable. 

If the value of the 1st variable is less than or equal to the second variable, it will evaluate to true. 

If the value of the first variable is greater than the second variable, it will evaluate to false.


![alt text](https://intermediatev3.codingcredentials.com/Lesson3/3/images/9.png?raw=true "LessThan")

## Step 10 @unplugged
** Greater Than Operator**
The symbol is the `>` sign. 

We can use this operator to check that the value of the 1st variable is greater than the 2nd variable. 

If the value of the 1st variable is greater than the second variable, it will evaluate to true. 

If the value of the first variable is equal to or less than the second variable, it will evaluate to false.


![alt text](https://intermediatev3.codingcredentials.com/Lesson3/3/images/10.png?raw=true "LessThan")

## Step 11 @unplugged
** Greater Than or Equal To Operator **
The symbol is the ≥ sign.

We can use this operator to check that the value of the 1st variable is greater than or equal to the 2nd variable. 

If the value of the 1st variable is greater than or equal to the second variable, it will evaluate to true. 

If the value of the first variable is less than the second variable, it will evaluate to false.
