# Intermediate Coding - Lesson 3.2 - Logic - Using Comparisonm Operators

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
**Comparison operators** allow you to compare 2 variables and determine if they are equal or not equal, one is less than or equal to the other, or if one is greater than or equal to the other. 

The comparison results in a boolean value of true or false.

They are typically used as conditions in ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` blocks and are also commonly used in loop which we will look at later.

## Step 2 @unplugged
**Using Comparison Operators in an IF THEN Statement**

``||LOGIC:Comparison Operator||`` blocks can be found in the ``||LOGIC:LOGIC||`` drawer in MakeCode.

## Step 3 @unplugged
**Using Comparison Operators in an IF THEN Statement**

The ``||LOGIC:Comparison Operator||``  block has 6 different comparison operators to compare the 2 variable values in different ways.

The comparison operator can be changed by selecting the down arrow.

## Step 4 @unplugged
**Using Comparison Operators in an IF THEN Statement**

Let's review the comparison operators. 

The **equals ( = ) operator** allows you to check if **2 values are exactly the same**. 

If the values are the same the comparison result is true. If they are not exactly the same the comparison result is false.

## Step 5 @unplugged
**Using Comparison Operators in an IF THEN Statement**

The **not equals ( ≠ ) operator** allows you to check if **2 values are not the same**. 

If the values are not the same the comparison result is true. If they are the same the comparison result is false.

## Step 6 @unplugged
**Using Comparison Operators in an IF THEN Statement**

The **less than ( < ) operator** allows you to check if the **1st value is less than the 2nd value**. 

If the first value is less than the 2nd value then the comparison result is true. If they are the same or the 1st value is greater than the second value the comparison result is false.

## Step 7 @unplugged
**Using Comparison Operators in an IF THEN Statement**

The **less than or equal to ( ≤  ) operator** allows you to check if the **1st value is less than or the same as the 2nd value**. 

If the first value is less than or the same as the 2nd value then the comparison result is true. If the 1st value is greater than the second value the comparison result is false.

## Step 8 @unplugged
**Using Comparison Operators in an IF THEN Statement**

The **greater than ( > ) operator** allows you to check if the **1st value is greater than the 2nd value**. 

If the first value is greater than the 2nd value then the comparison result is true. If they are the same or the 1st value is greater than the second value the comparison result is false.

## Step 9 @unplugged
**Using Comparison Operators in an IF THEN Statement**

The **greater than or equal to ( ≤  ) operator** allows you to check if the **1st value is greater than or the same as the 2nd value**. 

If the first value is greater than or the same as the 2nd value then the comparison result is true. If the 1st value is less than the second value the comparison result is false.
