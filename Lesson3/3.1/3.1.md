# Intermediate Coding - Lesson 3.1 - Logic - Using IF THEN Statements

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
**IF THEN** statements are used to perform logic in MakeCode. Using the ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` block we can run some blocks only if a certain condition exists.

## Step 2 @unplugged
**Creating an IF THEN Statement**

``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` blocks can be found in the ``||LOGIC:LOGIC||`` drawer in MakeCode.

## Step 3 @unplugged
**Creating an IF THEN Statement**

When you use an ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||``  block you need to replace the default ``||LOGIC:true Boolean||`` block with a condition. Place it between the if and then with any block which evaluates to a Boolean (either true or false - boolean logic will be discussed further in Lesson 4).

If you leave the default true block, any blocks you place inside the if then block will always run rather than only run if a condition is met.

## Step 4 @unplugged
**Creating an IF THEN Statement**

There are a number of blocks which evaluate to a Boolean in MakeCode.

These blocks are identified by their pointed ends as the 2 blocks in the pictures in the next steps.

We will look at the the comparison blocks later.


## Step 5 @unplugged
**Creating an IF THEN Statement**

The ``||BLOCKS:test for at||`` block from the ``||BLOCKS:BLOCKS||`` drawer allows you to check to see if a type of block is at a certain coordinate (either a positional or world coordinate). 
It will be true if it is at the tested block and false otherwise.

## Step 6 @unplugged
**Creating an IF THEN Statement**

The ``||AGENT:agent detect block forward||`` block from the ``||AGENT:AGENT||`` drawer is another block which evaluates to a Boolean.

This block allows you to test if there is a block at a certain position (in front, behind, above, below etc.) the Minecraft MakeCode Agent If there is a block at that position it will be true. It will be false if no block is at that position. This block can be useful when moving the agent around.

## Step 7 @unplugged
**Example**

This example is made up of 3 steps:
1. Fill  the 3 blocks directly in front of you with a grass block. 
2. Move the agent to your position.
3. If there is a block in front of the agent destroy that block.

The 3rd step is where we have used an ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` block.
The Boolean condition of the ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` block is using the ``||AGENT:agent deteck block forawrd||`` block to check if there is a block in front of the agent.

If there is a block this will be true and the blocks inside the if then statement will run. In this case, the first block, agent destroy forward, will make the agent destroy the block in front of them and leave you with only 2 grass blocks in front of you.
