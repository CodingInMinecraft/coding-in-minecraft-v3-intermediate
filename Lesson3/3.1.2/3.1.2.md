# Intermediate Coding - 3.1.2 - Logic - Using IF THEN Statements

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
Now that the agent can move forward by one block, let's add some more MakeCode blocks to allow the agent to do this 4 times.

## Step 2
Right click on the if then block and select the duplicate option.

Drag the duplicated series of blocks and place them after the agent move forward by 1 block.

```template
player.onChat("forward", function () {
    if (agent.detect(AgentDetection.Block, FORWARD)) {
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
    }
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
})
```
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("forward", function () {
    if (agent.detect(AgentDetection.Block, FORWARD)) {
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
    }
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
	if (agent.detect(AgentDetection.Block, FORWARD)) {
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
    }
})
```
## Step 3
Create a duplicate of the ``||AGENT:agent move forward by 1||`` block and place it after the ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` block we just placed.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("forward", function () {
    if (agent.detect(AgentDetection.Block, FORWARD)) {
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
    }
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
	if (agent.detect(AgentDetection.Block, FORWARD)) {
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
    }
	agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
})
```
## Step 4
Repeat the process of duplicating the ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` and ``||AGENT:agent move forward by 1||`` blocks another 2 times.

This will mean we have a total of 4 if then blocks and 4 agent move forward by 1 blocks.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("forward", function () {
    if (agent.detect(AgentDetection.Block, FORWARD)) {
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
    }
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
	if (agent.detect(AgentDetection.Block, FORWARD)) {
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
    }
	agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
	if (agent.detect(AgentDetection.Block, FORWARD)) {
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
    }
	if (agent.detect(AgentDetection.Block, FORWARD)) {
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
    }
	agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
})
```
## Step 5
Next let's test the code.

Click Next for instructions on how to test your code.

## Step 6 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step, click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. Open the **chat window** by pressing the t key on the keyboard or tapping the chat icon.
3. Enter the command forward and press the return key on the keyboard. Notice that agent destroyed any blocks in front of it and moved forward 4 blocks.

## Step 7
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.

## Step 8 @tutorialCompleted
Return to the game and move onto the next non-player character.
