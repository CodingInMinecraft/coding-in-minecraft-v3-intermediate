# Intermediate Coding - 3.1.1 - Logic - Using IF THEN Statements

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
In this activity we will use ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` blocks to add some functionality to our Minecraft game.

We will create a program which will allow our agent to move forwards 4 blocks and destroy any blocks positioned along the way.

In this program we will move the agent to our current location and move it forward 4 times, each time checking if a block is in front of it and if so destroying it.

## Step 2
From the ``||PLAYER:PLAYER||`` drawer drag out an ``||PLAYER:on chat command||`` event block. 

Change it to respond to the chat command forward.
#### ~ tutorialhint
Open the PLAYER drawer and place a on chat command "jump" anywhere on the blue area.
```blocks
player.onChat("forward",function () {
 
})
)
```
## Step 3
Add an ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` block from the ``||LOGIC:LOGIC||`` drawer and put it inside the ``||PLAYER:on chat command||`` block.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("forward",function () {
	if (true) {
    }
})
)
```

## Step 4
From the ``||AGENT:AGENT||`` drawer place an ``||AGENT:agent detect block forward||`` block on top of the ``||LOGIC:true||`` block in the ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` block to replace the ``||LOGIC:true||`` block.

This has created an if then block which if a block is in front of the agent any blocks inside the if then block will run.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("forward",function () {
	if (agent.detect(AgentDetection.Block, FORWARD)) {
    	
    }
})
)
```

## Step 5
From the ``||AGENT:AGENT||`` drawer place an ``||AGENT:agent destroy forward||`` block inside the ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` block.

This will destroy the block in front of the agent and as it is inside the if then block will only run when the condition in the ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` block is ``||LOGIC:true||``, which in this case is when there is a block in front of the agent.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("forward", function () {
    if (agent.detect(AgentDetection.Block, FORWARD)) {
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
    }
})
```

## Step 6
Next we want to add an ``||AGENT:agent move forward by 1||`` block from the ``||AGENT:AGENT||`` drawer after the ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` block.

We now have enough blocks that should allow our agent to move forward by one block no matter if there is a block in front of them or not.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("forward", function () {
    if (agent.detect(AgentDetection.Block, FORWARD)) {
        agent.destroy(FORWARD)
    }
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
})
```
## Step 7
Next let's test the code so far before we move on and make it work for the 4 blocks in front of us.

Click Next for instructions on how to test your code.

## Step 8 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step, click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. Face the entrance to the Logic island as this is the forward direction.
3. Open the **chat window** by pressing the t key on the keyboard or tapping the chat icon.
4. Type the word forward and press Enter.
5. Notice that your Agent destroys the block in front of it and then moves forward by one block.

## Step 9
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.

## Step 10 @tutorialCompleted
Return to the game and move onto the next activity.
