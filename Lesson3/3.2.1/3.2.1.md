# Intermediate Coding - 3.2.1 - Logic - Comparison Operators Activity

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
In this activity we will create a program which will track the number of a chosen type of block placed.

In this program we will create a variable to track the number of blocks placed which we will update when we place or destroy a block of our chosen type. 

## Step 2
From the ``||VARIABLES:VARIABLES||`` drawer create a new variable named noOfBlocksPlaced.

This will be the variable we use to keep track of the number of blocks placed.

## Step 3
From the ``||BLOCKS:BLOCKS||`` drawer drag out an ``||BLOCKS:on block placed||`` block. Change it to the Stone block.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
blocks.onBlockPlaced(STONE, function () {
	
})
```
## Step 4
From the ``||VARIABLES:VARIABLES||`` drawer drag out a ``||VARIABLES:change item by 1||``block and change the variable to the noOfBlocksPlaced variable by clicking on the down arrow.

This will add one onto the noOfBlocksPlaced variable every time we place a grass block.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
blocks.onBlockPlaced(STONE, function () {
    noOfBlocksPlaced += 1
})
```

## Step 5
Every time we destroy a block we want to reduce the noOfBlocksPlaced variable by 1.

To do so drag a ``||BLOCKS:on block broken||`` block from the ``||BLOCKS:BLOCKS||`` drawer and place a ``||VARIABLES:set variable to 0||`` block inside it. Remember to change the type of block to the Stone block. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
blocks.onBlockBroken(STONE, function () {
    noOfBlocksPlaced = 0
})
blocks.onBlockPlaced(STONE, function () {
    noOfBlocksPlaced += 1
})
```

## Step 6
Change the variable to the noOfBlocksPlaced variable and place a ``||MATH:0 - 0||`` block from the ``||MATH:MATH||`` drawer in place of the number 0. 

In the ``||MATH:0 - 0||`` block change the first variable to the noOfBlocksPlaced variable and the second variable to 1.

This will reduce the variable value when we destroy a block.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
blocks.onBlockBroken(STONE, function () {
    noOfBlocksPlaced = noOfBlocksPlaced - 1
})
blocks.onBlockPlaced(STONE, function () {
    noOfBlocksPlaced += 1
})
```

## Step 7
From the ``||PLAYER:PLAYER||`` drawer place a ``||PLAYER:say ":)"||`` block in the ``||BLOCKS:on block placed||`` block. We will use this to tell the player how many of that type of block they have used.

From the ``||TEXT:TEXT||`` drawer place a ``||TEXT:join "Hello" "World"||`` block in the ``||PLAYER:say ":)"||`` block.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
blocks.onBlockBroken(STONE, function () {
    noOfBlocksPlaced = noOfBlocksPlaced - 1
})
blocks.onBlockPlaced(STONE, function () {
    noOfBlocksPlaced += 1
    player.say("Hello" + "World")
})
```
## Step 8
Change the first text variable "Hello" to "Number of blocks placed" and from the variables drawer drag a noOfBlocksPlaced block and place it over the "World" string block.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
blocks.onBlockBroken(STONE, function () {
    noOfBlocksPlaced = noOfBlocksPlaced - 1
})
blocks.onBlockPlaced(STONE, function () {
    noOfBlocksPlaced += 1
    player.say("Number of blocks placed: " + noOfBlocksPlaced)
})

```

## Step 9
The code we now have will count the number of stone blocks and tell the player the number of blocks placed when we place a block.

Let's give our player stone blocks to use so we can test the code.  
From the ``||LOOPS:LOOPS||`` drawer place a ``||LOOPS:on start||`` block on the workspace.  

From the ``||MOBS:MOBS||`` drawer place a ``||MOBS:give nearest player block or item||`` block in the ``||LOOPS:on start||`` block. Change nearest player to yourself and change the block to Stone.
Set the amount to 64. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
blocks.onBlockBroken(STONE, function () {
    noOfBlocksPlaced = noOfBlocksPlaced - 1
})
blocks.onBlockPlaced(STONE, function () {
    noOfBlocksPlaced += 1
    player.say("Number of blocks placed: " + noOfBlocksPlaced)
})
mobs.give(
mobs.target(LOCAL_PLAYER),
STONE,
64
)
```


## Step 10 

Lets test our code.

## Step 11 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. You will notice that your player now has stone blocks.  Select the spot on the hotbar that contains the stone blocks. 

3. Place some blocks around you and notice the chat messages appearing stating the number of blocks placed.
Be sure to destroy all the blocks you placed before continuing.

## Step 12
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.
