# Intermediate Coding - 3.2.2 - Logic - Comparison Operators Activity

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
In this activity we will extend our previous activity to use comparison operators to enhance the functionality of ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` blocks.

We will create a program which will track the number of a chosen type of block placed and every time we lay 5 blocks we will tell the player the total amount of blocks laid.

In this program we will create a variable to track the number of blocks placed which we will update when we lay or destroy a block of our chosen type. When this variable reaches a value which is divisible by 5 we will tell the player the total number of blocks currently laid.

## Step 2 @unplugged
Now that we can track the number of blocks placed and tell the player lets change our code so it only tells the player every time a multiple of 5 blocks is placed (i.e. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25...)

```template
blocks.onBlockBroken(GRASS, function () {
    noOfBlocksPlaced = noOfBlocksPlaced - 1
})
blocks.onBlockPlaced(GRASS, function () {
    noOfBlocksPlaced += 1
    player.say("Number of blocks placed: " + noOfBlocksPlaced)
})
```

## Step 3
From the ``||LOGIC:LOGIC||`` drawer drag an ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` block and place it around the ``||PLAYER:say ""||`` block in the ``||BLOCKS:on block placed||`` block.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
blocks.onBlockBroken(GRASS, function () {
    noOfBlocksPlaced = noOfBlocksPlaced - 1
})
blocks.onBlockPlaced(GRASS, function () {
    noOfBlocksPlaced += 1
    if (true) {
        player.say("Number of blocks placed: " + noOfBlocksPlaced)
    }
})
```
## Step 4
Drag a ``||LOGIC:0 = 0||`` comparison block from the ``||LOGIC:LOGIC||`` drawer and drop it on top of the true block in the ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` block.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
blocks.onBlockBroken(GRASS, function () {
    noOfBlocksPlaced = noOfBlocksPlaced - 1
})
blocks.onBlockPlaced(GRASS, function () {
    noOfBlocksPlaced += 1
    if (0 == 0) {
        player.say("Number of blocks placed: " + noOfBlocksPlaced)
    }
})
```

## Step 5
Place a ``||MATH:remainder of 0 ÷ 1||`` block from the ``||MATH:MATH||`` drawer and place it on top of the first 0 in the comparison block.

This block allows us to get the remainder of division mathematical sum.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
blocks.onBlockBroken(GRASS, function () {
    noOfBlocksPlaced = noOfBlocksPlaced - 1
})
blocks.onBlockPlaced(GRASS, function () {
    noOfBlocksPlaced += 1
    if (0 % 1 == 0) {
        player.say("Number of blocks placed: " + noOfBlocksPlaced)
    }
})
```

## Step 6
From the ``||VARIABLES:VARIABLES||`` drawer place a ``||VARIABLES:noOfBlocksPlaced||`` block on the 0 variable block in the ``||MATH:remainder of 0 ÷ 1||`` block and change the second number variable (1) to 5.

In our logic if the number of blocks is divisible by 5 with no remainder the current number of blocks placed is a multiple of 5.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
blocks.onBlockBroken(GRASS, function () {
    noOfBlocksPlaced = noOfBlocksPlaced - 1
})
blocks.onBlockPlaced(GRASS, function () {
    noOfBlocksPlaced += 1
    if (noOfBlocksPlaced % 5 == 0) {
        player.say("Number of blocks placed: " + noOfBlocksPlaced)
    }
})
```

## Step 8 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. If you havent already place some blocks of your chosen type into your inventory and equip yourself with them.
3. Place **5 blocks** and notice the chat message appears when you place the 5th block

4. Place another 5 blocks and notice a chat message appears when you place the 10th block.

## Step 9
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.
