# Intermediate Coding - 3.2.2 - Logic - Comparison Operators Activity

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
In this activity, we will extend our previous activity to use comparison operators to enhance the functionality of ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` blocks.

We will create a program which will track the number of a chosen type of block placed and every time we lay 5 blocks we will tell the player the total amount of blocks laid.

In this program, we will create a variable to track the number of blocks placed, which we will update when we lay or destroy a block of our chosen type. When this variable reaches a value which is divisible by 5 we will tell the player the total number of blocks currently laid.

## Step 2 @unplugged
Now that we can track the number of blocks placed and tell the player, let's change our code so it only tells the player every time a multiple of 5 blocks is placed (i.e. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25...).

```template
blocks.onBlockBroken(STONE, function () {
    noOfBlocksPlaced = noOfBlocksPlaced - 1
})
blocks.onBlockPlaced(STONE, function () {
    noOfBlocksPlaced += 1
    player.say("Number of blocks placed: " + noOfBlocksPlaced)
})
mobs.give(
mobs.target(LOCAL_PLAYER),
STONE,
64
)
```

## Step 3
From the ``||LOGIC:LOGIC||`` drawer drag an ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` block and place it around the ``||PLAYER:say ""||`` block in the ``||BLOCKS:on block placed||`` block.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
blocks.onBlockBroken(STONE, function () {
    noOfBlocksPlaced += noOfBlocksPlaced - 1
})
blocks.onBlockPlaced(STONE, function () {
    noOfBlocksPlaced += 1
    if (true) {
        player.say("Number of blocks placed: " + noOfBlocksPlaced)
    }
})
let noOfBlocksPlaced = 0
mobs.give(
mobs.target(LOCAL_PLAYER),
STONE,
64
)
```

## Step 4
Drag a ``||LOGIC:0 = 0||`` comparison block from the ``||LOGIC:LOGIC||`` drawer and drop it on top of the true block in the ``||LOGIC:IF THEN||`` block.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
blocks.onBlockBroken(STONE, function () {
    noOfBlocksPlaced += noOfBlocksPlaced - 1
})
blocks.onBlockPlaced(STONE, function () {
    noOfBlocksPlaced += 1
    if (0 == 0) {
        player.say("Number of blocks placed: " + noOfBlocksPlaced)
    }
})
let noOfBlocksPlaced = 0
mobs.give(
mobs.target(LOCAL_PLAYER),
STONE,
64
)
```

## Step 5
Place a ``||MATH:remainder of 0 รท 1||`` block from the ``||MATH:MATH||`` drawer and place it on top of the first 0 in the comparison block.

This block allows us to get the remainder of division mathematical sum.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
blocks.onBlockBroken(STONE, function () {
    noOfBlocksPlaced += noOfBlocksPlaced - 1
})
blocks.onBlockPlaced(STONE, function () {
    noOfBlocksPlaced += 1
    if (0 % 1 == 0) {
        player.say("Number of blocks placed: " + noOfBlocksPlaced)
    }
})
let noOfBlocksPlaced = 0
mobs.give(
mobs.target(LOCAL_PLAYER),
STONE,
64
)
```

## Step 6
From the ``||VARIABLES:VARIABLES||`` drawer place a ``||VARIABLES:noOfBlocksPlaced||`` block on the 0 variable block in the ``||MATH:remainder of 0 รท 1||`` block and change the second number variable (1) to 5.

In our logic, if the number of blocks is divisible by 5 with no remainder the current number of blocks placed is a multiple of 5.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
blocks.onBlockBroken(STONE, function () {
    noOfBlocksPlaced += noOfBlocksPlaced - 1
})
blocks.onBlockPlaced(STONE, function () {
    noOfBlocksPlaced += 1
    if (noOfBlocksPlaced % 5 == 0) {
        player.say("Number of blocks placed: " + noOfBlocksPlaced)
    }
})
let noOfBlocksPlaced = 0
mobs.give(
mobs.target(LOCAL_PLAYER),
STONE,
64
)
```
