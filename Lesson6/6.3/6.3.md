# Intermediate Coding - Lesson 6.3 - Advanced Loops - Modularity

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
**Modularity** is a key concept in coding.

In previous lessons, you have used loops to repeat actions multiple times such as coding the agent to build a fenced pen. This allowed us to run the same code multiple times rather than having multiple lines of code performing the same action.

Modularity allows for re-use of code and a reduction in code repetition.

Modularity is the process of splitting your code into smaller re-usable pieces. Each piece may be fully functional on its own or contain common functionaility which may be reusable.

Modularity can sometimes be referred to as creating procedures, functions or sub-routines.

## Step 2 @unplugged
**Modularity - Reducing Code Repetition**

At times you may need to perform the same action at different points in your program. For example, if we wanted to write some code to have the Agent Mine and collect blocks we could use the below series of blocks to perform this action twice or more than twice if we keep repeating the 4 blocks ``||AGENT:agent destroy forward||``, ``||AGENT:agent collect all||``, ``||AGENT:agent move forward by 1||`` and ``||PLAYER:say "Agent mined a block!"||``.

## Step 3 @unplugged
**Modularity - Reducing Code Repetition**

This repetion of the same series of steps is not ideal. What if we wanted to change the text which was displayed after the block was mined? We would have to change this multiple times and it may be easy to make a mistake when doing so.

We have already seen how we could use a loop to repeat the common blocks of code as below:

## Step 4 @unplugged
**Modularity - Reducing Code Repetition**
We could use a loop to reduce the repetion of code blocks or we could separate the code which will be repeated into a separate **function** as below:

The blocks contained within the function will all be run in sequence when we call the function.

This is great, but what if we wanted to use the same code elewhere in our program?

## Step 5 @unplugged
**Modularity - Code Reuse**

If we wanted to use the same sequence of blocks in multiple parts of our program this would usually involve repeating the code blocks
e.g. in multiple ``||PLAYER:on chat command||`` blocks.

Code reuse and reducing code repetition makes our program more efficient and easier to maintain in the future should we need fix issues or update.

## Step 6 @unplugged
**Modularity - Code Reuse**

Code reuse and reducing code repetition makes our program more efficient and easier to maintain in the future should we need fix issues or update.

In the previous example, the 4 blocks within each loop were the same. These blocks were the blocks performing the mining. If at somepoint in the future we wanted to change how the Agent mined (e.g. change the text displayed after each block was mined) we would need to update our code in 2 places.

To avoid this, we can place the common code blocks within a separate **function** using a ``||FUNCTIONS:function||`` block and calling this function within each loop using a ``||FUNCTION:call||`` block.

## Step 7 @unplugged
**Modularity - Functions**

**Functions** can also have arguments (also known as parameters). This is just like in Lesson 2 where you used ``||PLAYER:on chat command||`` blocks and passed arguments into it to change what happened in the code.
Arguments/parameters can be:
	- Text
	- Number
	- Boolean
	- Position
