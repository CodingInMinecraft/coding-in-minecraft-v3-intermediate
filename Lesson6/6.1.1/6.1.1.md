# Intermediate Coding - Lesson 6.1.1 - Advanced Loops - Using forever loops & the pause command activity
### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged

In this activity we will use ``||LOOPS: forever||`` blocks and the ``||LOOPS:pause (ms) 100||`` block to add some functionality to our Minecraft game.

In this program we will create a program which will change any blocks under us to brick blocks to form a path of where we walk.

We will then extend our program to make our agent dance!

## Step 2
From the ``||LOOPS:LOOPS||`` drawer drag out a ``||LOOPS: forever||`` block.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks
loops.forever(function () {
	
})
)
```
## Step 3
From the ``||BLOCKS:BLOCKS||`` drawer place a ``||BLOCKS:place block at 0 0 0||`` block inside the forever loop and change the type of block to a brick block and the Y coordinate to -1 to provide the position of the block directly below us.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
loops.forever(function () {
    blocks.place(GRASS, pos(0, -1, 0))
})

```
