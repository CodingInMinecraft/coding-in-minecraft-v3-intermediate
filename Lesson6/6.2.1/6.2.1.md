# Intermediate Coding - Lesson 6.2.1 - Advanced Loops - Using on start activity

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
In this activity we will use an ``||LOOPS:on start||`` block to add some functionality to our Minecraft game.

In this program we will use some blocks of code which will spawn a random number of chickens in the play area surrounding up when the program starts.

## Step 2
A ``||LOOPS:on start||`` block is usually already placed for you but if not from the ``||LOOPS:LOOPS||`` drawer drag out a ``||LOOPS:on start||`` block.

## Step 3
From the ``||VARIABLES:VARIABLES||`` drawer create a variable named **noOfChickens**. We will use this variable to set the number of chickens to spawn on the program start.

## Step 4
From the ``||VARIABLES:VARIABLES||`` drawer drag a ``||VARIABLES:set item to 0 ||``  block inside the on start event and change the variable to the noOfChickens variable.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
let noOfChickens = 0
})

```

## Step 5
Place a ``||MATH:random 0 to 10||`` block from the ``||MATH:MATH||`` drawer on the 0 variable in the ``||VARIABLES:set noOfChickens to 0 ||`` block and change the first number variable to 1.

This will set the value of the noOfChickens variable to a random number between 1 and 10.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
let noOfChickens = Math.randomRange(1, 10)
```

## Step 6
From the ``||PLAYER:PLAYER||`` drawer place a ``||PLAYER:say ":)"||`` block after the previous block
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
let noOfChickens = Math.randomRange(1, 10)
player.say(":)")
```
## Step 6
From the ``||TEXT:TEXT||`` drawer place a ``||TEXT:join "Hello" "World"||`` block on top of the ":)" block.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
let noOfChickens = Math.randomRange(1, 10)
player.say("Hello " + "World")
```

## Step 6
Change the text in the first text block in the ``||TEXT:join "Hello" "World"||`` block to Number of chickens: and from the ``||VARIABLES:VARIABLES||`` drawer place a ``||VARIABLES:noOfChickens||``  block on the second text block in the ``||TEXT:join "Hello" "World"||`` block.

This will just display a message telling us how many chickens should be spawned!
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
let noOfChickens = Math.randomRange(1, 10)
player.say("Number of chickens: " + noOfChickens)
```

## Step 7
From the ``||LOOPS:LOOPS||`` drawer place a ``||LOOPS:repeat 4 times loop||``  block after the ``||PLAYER:say||`` block
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
let noOfChickens = Math.randomRange(1, 10)
player.say("Number of chickens: " + noOfChickens)
for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
	
}
```
## Step 8
Replace the default value of 4 loop enumerations in the ``||LOOPS:repeat 4 times loop||`` block with the variable ``||VARIABLES:noOfChickens||`` to make the loop run this number of times.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
let noOfChickens = Math.randomRange(1, 10)
player.say("Number of chickens: " + noOfChickens)
for (let index = 0; index < noOfChickens; index++) {
	
}
```

## Step 9
From the ``||MOBS:MOBS||`` drawer place a ``||MOBS:spawn animal at ~0 ~0 ~0||`` block inside the repeat loop.

This will cause a chicken to be spawned at your current position

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
let noOfChickens = Math.randomRange(1, 10)
player.say("Number of chickens: " + noOfChickens)
for (let index = 0; index < noOfChickens; index++) {
	mobs.spawn(CHICKEN, pos(0, 0, 0))
}
```

## Step 10
Lets change the position the chicken is spawned by replacing the ``||POSITIONS:~0 ~0 ~0||`` coordinate block with a ``||POSITIONS:pick random position from ~0 ~0 ~0 to ~0 ~0 ~0||`` block from the ``||POSITIONS:POSITIONS||`` drawer
.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
let noOfChickens = Math.randomRange(1, 10)
player.say("Number of chickens: " + noOfChickens)
for (let index = 0; index < noOfChickens; index++) {
	mobs.spawn(CHICKEN, randpos(
    pos(0, 0, 0),
    pos(0, 0, 0)
    ))
}
```

## Step 11
Change the values of the 2 position variables in the pick random position block to ``||POSITIONS:~-5 ~0 ~-5||``  and ``||POSITIONS:~5 ~20 ~5||``. 

This will cause the chicken to be spawned somewhere in the area around the player up to 5 blocks above the player.
.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
let noOfChickens = Math.randomRange(1, 10)
player.say("Number of chickens: " + noOfChickens)
for (let index = 0; index < noOfChickens; index++) {
	mobs.spawn(CHICKEN, randpos(
    pos(-5, 0, -5),
    pos(5, 20, 5)
    ))
}
```

## Step 12
Finally lets slow things down so not all chickens get spawned at the same time.

Place a ``||LOOPS:pause (ms) 400||`` block at the end of the loop and change the value to **1000** so it pauses for 1 second after each chicken is spawned.
.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
let noOfChickens = Math.randomRange(1, 10)
player.say("Number of chickens: " + noOfChickens)
for (let index = 0; index < noOfChickens; index++) {
	mobs.spawn(CHICKEN, randpos(
    pos(-5, 0, -5),
    pos(5, 20, 5)
    ))
	loops.pause(1000)
}
```

## Step 13
Next lets test the code.

Click Next for instructions on how to test your code.

## Step 14 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click the **Green Play button** to start your code running.

2. Look around your Minecraft world.
Notice the chat message stating the number of chickens which will be spawned and over the next few seconds a chicken should be spawned at a random location around you every second.

## Step 15
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.
