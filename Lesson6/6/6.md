# Intermediate Coding - Lesson 6 - Advanced Loops

## Step 1 @unplugged
There are 2 other loops we will look at - the **forever loop** and **on start**

Alongside these loops we will also look at the **pause** command which can be useful in any loop.

The forever loop can be used to run blocks of code continuously forever.

The on start loop allows us to run some blocks when the game starts.

Can you think of a time when you wanted to repeat something forever or something every few seconds or minutes?

- What about breathing or your heart beating - this is something which repeats forever
- How about the clock ticking - it ticks every second

When the game starts you may want to do some set up such as spawn some mobs randomly or change the game mode.
## Step 2 @unplugged
Loops can be found in the ``||LOOPS:LOOPS||`` drawer in MakeCode

## Step 3 @unplugged
Forever loops

A **Forever** loop is a special type of loop which sits on its own (i.e. not nested inside another block like other loops)
and starts running as soon as your code starts and continues to run until the game ends.

All the blocks inside the forever loop will run one after the other continuously.

This is a very useful loop when you want something to happen over and over again automatically.

## Step 4 @unplugged
On start loop

The **On Start** loop is another type of special loop which sits on its own (i.e. not nested inside another block like other loops) and starts running as soon as your code starts.

The difference between the On Start loop and the Forever loop is the blocks inside the On Start loop **only run once**, not continuously.

This is a very useful loop when you want to set something up when your program starts.

## Step 5 @unplugged
Pause command

The Pause command is a block which is commonly used in loops, in particular the forever loop.

This command allows you to pause and wait for a period of time measured in milliseconds.

1 second contains 1000 milliseconds.
