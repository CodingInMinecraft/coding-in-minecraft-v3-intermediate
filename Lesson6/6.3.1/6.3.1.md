# Intermediate Coding - Lesson 6.3.1 - Advanced Loops - Modularity 

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
In this activity we will use a ``||FUNCTIONS:function||`` block to make our code reusable and easy to maintain.

In this program we will create a function which can build 1 level of a structure (a simple house) and be called multiple times to repeat this process to build upwards.

## Step 2 @unplugged
To build a hollow structure as in the below picture 

![alt text](https://intermediatev3.codingcredentials.com/Lesson6/6.3.1/images/1.png?raw=true "build")

We could use the below code blocks to have the agent lay a series of blocks to make one wall, turn and create another wall and when the 4 walls are complete move up one block and repeat the process.

![alt text](https://intermediatev3.codingcredentials.com/Lesson6/6.3.1/images/2.png?raw=true "build")

## Step 3 
The code in the picture in the previous step have been provided for you below.

Run this code by returning to the Minecraft world by clicking the Green Play button and entering the text **build** in the chat windows and look at how the Agent follows the instructions to create a wall, turn, create another wall, when 4 walls are created move up 1 block and repeat the process.

Dont forget to give your Agent some inventory in their slot 1!

Open Code Builder again by pressing the c key on your keyboard or tapping the Agent icon once you have run the code.

```template
player.onChat("build", function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 3; index++) {
        agent.move(UP, 1)
        for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
            for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
                agent.place(DOWN)
                agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
            }
            agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
        }
    }
})
```

## Step 4
What if we wanted to be able to resuse this code to maybe create structures with different wall lengths or heights?

At the minute we would need to change our code (the number variable in the loops) to change either the length or height of the structure.

Lets break our code into multiple functions to enable them to be reused and called from multiple places.

From the ``||FUNCTIONS:FUNCTIONS||`` click on the Make a Function button.

Replace the default function name of doSomething with **buildWall** - buildWall will be the name of our function and will be what we use to call the function to make all the blocks in the function run.

Click on the Number option to add a number parameter - this parameter will be used to set the length of the wall. Change the parameter name to length.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
function buildWall (length: number) {
	
}

```
## Step 5
Remember that the process to build a wall is for the Agent to place a block below them and move forward by 1 as many times a needed to fill the length of the wall.

Add a ``||LOOPS:repeat 4 times loop||`` from the ``||LOOPS:LOOPS||`` drawer and set the loop control variable to be the function parameter length. To do this drag the ``||VARIABLES:length||`` block from the ``||FUNCTIONS:function buildwall length||`` block.
Then add a ``||AGENT: agent place down||`` block and a ``||AGENT: agent move forward by 1||`` block from the ``||AGENT:AGENT||`` drawer inside the repeat loop. 
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
function buildWall (length: number) {
    for (let index = 0; index < length; index++) {
        agent.place(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    }
}
```

##Step 6
Now that we have built a single wall lets create a function that will build a single story/floor/level of a building by calling the buildWall function and making a 90 degree turn 4 times.

To do this lets create a new function named buildFloor (with no parameters) just as we created the buildWall functions.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
function buildFloor () {

}
function buildWall (length: number) {
    for (let index = 0; index < length; index++) {
        agent.place(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    }
}
```

## Step 7
In the buildFloor function add a ``||LOOPS:repeat 4 times||`` loop.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
function buildWall (length: number) {
    for (let index = 0; index < length; index++) {
        agent.place(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    }
}
function buildFloor () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
    	
    }
}
```

## Step 8
From the ``||FUNCTIONS:FUNCTIONS||`` drawer drag a call ``||FUNCTIONS:call buildWall 1||`` block and place it inside the ``||LOOPS:repeat 4 times loop||`` loop and change the parameter value from 1 to 4 to build 4 walls rather than 1.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
function buildWall (length: number) {
    for (let index = 0; index < length; index++) {
        agent.place(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    }
}
function buildFloor () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
        buildWall(4)
    }
}
```

## Step 9
After the ``||FUNCTIONS:call buildWall 4||`` block place an ``||AGENT:agent turn right||`` block to turn your Agent right after building a wall
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
function buildWall (length: number) {
    for (let index = 0; index < length; index++) {
        agent.place(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    }
}
function buildFloor () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
        buildWall(4)
        agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    }
}
```

## Step 10
We have now created 2 functions which will build 4 walls 1 block high in the shape of a square when we run the code.

Next we will use some blocks to make the Agent build upwards and repeat the code we have already created to build multiple storys/levels/floors.

To do this create another function named buildHouse which has a Number parameter named height.


#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
function buildHouse (height: number) {
	
}
function buildFloor () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
        buildWall(4)
        agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    }
}
function buildWall (length: number) {
    for (let index = 0; index < length; index++) {
        agent.place(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    }
}
```

## Step 11
In this function we will move the Agent up by one block and call the buildFloor function to build a floor. We will repeat this the number of times indicated by the height parameter.

In the buildHouse function add a ``||LOOPS:repeat 4 times loop||`` loop and replace the loop control variable with the height parameter. To do this drag the ``||VARIABLES:height||`` block from the ``||FUNCTIONS:function buildHouse height||`` block
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
function buildHouse (height: number) {
    for (let index = 0; index < height; index++) {
    	
    }
}
function buildFloor () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
        buildWall(4)
        agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    }
}
function buildWall (length: number) {
    for (let index = 0; index < length; index++) {
        agent.place(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    }
}
```
## Step 12
Within the ``||LOOPS:repeat height times loop||`` loop add an ``||AGENT:agent move up by 1||`` block followed by a ``||FUNCTIONS:call buildFloor||`` block.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
function buildHouse (height: number) {
    for (let index = 0; index < height; index++) {
        agent.move(UP, 1)
        buildFloor()
    }
}
function buildFloor () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
        buildWall(1)
        agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    }
}
function buildWall (length: number) {
    for (let index = 0; index < length; index++) {
        agent.place(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    }
}
```

## Step 13
We have now created 3 functions which when called in the correct order can be used to build a structure. To test this out and run our code add a ``||PLAYER:on chat command jump||`` block and change it to respond to the text run
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("run", function () {
	
})
```
## Step 14
The final step we need to perform in order to run our code to test it is to call the buildHouse function and specifiy how high we want the building to be. 

To do this place a ``||FUNCTIONS:call buildHouse 1||`` block and change the parameter value to 3 to build a house 3 levels/storys/floors high.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("run", function () {
    buildHouse(3)
})
function buildHouse (height: number) {
    for (let index = 0; index < height; index++) {
        agent.move(UP, 1)
        buildFloor()
    }
}
function buildFloor () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
        buildWall(1)
        agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
    }
}
function buildWall (length: number) {
    for (let index = 0; index < length; index++) {
        agent.place(DOWN)
        agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    }
}
```
