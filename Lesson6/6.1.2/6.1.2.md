# Intermediate Coding - Lesson 6.1.2 - Advanced Loops - Using forever loops & the pause command activity

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
Now lets use a forever loop to make the agent dance around!

## Step 2
Add a ``||LOOPS: forever||`` loop block.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks
loops.forever(function () {
    
})
```

## Step 3
You decide how to move the agent!

Use a series of ``||AGENT:move ...||`` and ``||AGENT:agent turn ...||`` blocks to move your agent about.

Combine these with loops to perform the same action multiple time.

Place ``||LOOPS:pause (ms) ...||`` at points within your series of blocks to get your agent to stop - set the values of the pause blocks to be anything from 100 to 5000 milliseconds (one tenth of a second to 5 seconds).
#### ~ tutorialhint
The below is just an example - create your own movements!
```blocks 
loops.forever(function () {
    loops.pause(1000)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 5)
    agent.move(LEFT, 3)
    for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
        agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
    }
    loops.pause(500)
    agent.move(BACK, 3)
    loops.pause(100)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 3)
    agent.move(RIGHT, 6)
    loops.pause(1500)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 2)
    agent.move(BACK, 4)
})
```
## Step 4
Next lets test the code.

## Step 6
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.
