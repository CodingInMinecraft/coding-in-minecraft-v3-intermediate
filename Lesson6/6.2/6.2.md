## Step 3 @unplugged
**Creating an on start event**

The **on start** event is a special event which will start running when the program starts before anything else runs.

Any blocks placed inside the on start event block will be run, one after the other, before any other blocks in the program.

It is used to ensure some code to set up your program such as setting the starting value of a variable.
