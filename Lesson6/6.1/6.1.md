# Intermediate Coding - Lesson 6.1 - Advanced Loops - Using forever loops & the pause command


### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
**Forever** loops allow us to continuously run a series of blocks from the start of the program until the program ends.

The **pause** command allows you pause your code from running for a set number of milliseconds (1 second = 1000 milliseconds).

## Step 2 @unplugged
**Creating a forever loop**

``||LOOPS: forever||`` loop blocks can be found in the ``||LOOPS:LOOPS||`` drawer in MakeCode.

## Step 3 @unplugged
**Creating a forever loop**

The **forever** loop is a special loop which will **start running when the program starts and stop running when the program ends.**

Any blocks placed inside the forever loop block will be run, one after the other, continuously  until the program ends.

The forever loop is a stand alone block which isn't placed inside another block like other loop blocks.

## Step 4 @unplugged
**Forever loop - example**

In this example, a forever loop is used to run the same blocks continuously.

When the code starts running a gold block will be placed under the players feet.

This will continue to happen until the program is ended.

## Step 5 @unplugged
**The pause command**

The ``||LOOPS:pause (ms) 100||`` block can be found in the ``||LOOPS:LOOPS||`` drawer in MakeCode.

The ``||LOOPS:pause (ms) 100||`` block stops your program from running for a period of milliseconds. 

There are 1000 milliseconds in 1 second therefore if we want to pause for 1 second we would set its value to 1000.

The default value is 100 milliseconds which is one tenth of a second.

## Step 6 @unplugged
**Pause - example**

In this example, a forever loop is used to run some blocks of code continuously.

A pause command has been added with the value of 5000 to stop the code running for 5 seconds before running again.

If this pause command was not added to the forever loop chickens would be continuously be spawned very fast!

With the pause command a chicken is spawned every 5 seconds.
