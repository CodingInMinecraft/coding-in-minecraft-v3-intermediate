# Intermediate Coding - Lesson 2 - Activity 3

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
In this activity we will expand on our previous code and use arguments with the chat commands to provide the values for variables during gameplay.

First we will add a chat command which allows us to jump a number of blocks on the Y axis - the number of blocks to be jumped can be provided during the game.

## Step 2
From the ``||PLAYER:PLAYER||`` drawer drag out an ``||PLAYER:on chat command||`` event block and set it to respond to the command **jump**
#### ~ tutorialhint
Open the PLAYER drawer and place a on chat command "jump" anywhere on the blue area
```blocks
player.onChat("jump",function () {
 
})

```
## Step 3
Add a ``||PLAYER:TELEPORT ~0 ~0 ~0||`` block from the Player drawer to the ``||PLAYER:on chat command "jump"||``.

This will cause the player to teleport to their current location.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("jump",function () {
	player.teleport(pos(0, 0, 0))
})

```

## Step 4
Click on the + symbol to the right of the ``||PLAYER:on chat command "jump"||`` block

This will add a variable called **num1**.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("jump",function (num1) {
	player.teleport(pos(0, 0, 0))
})

```

## Step 5
Click on the down arrow to the right of the word num1 and choose Rename variable and enter **Y** as the variable name.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("jump",function (Y) {
	player.teleport(pos(0, 0, 0))
})

```

## Step 6
Open the ``||VARIABLE:VARIABLE||`` drawer and notice there is now a Y variable.

Drag this variable and drop it on the Y position of the relative position block in the teleport to block.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("jump",function (Y) {
	player.teleport(pos(0, Y, 0))
})
```

## Step 7

## Step 8 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. When back in the game open the **chat window** by pressing the t key on the keyboard or tapping the chat icon.
3. Enter the command jump followed by a space and the number 30 i.e. **jump 30**. And press the enter key on the keyboard.
4. Notice that you have jumped 30 blocks up! Try to change the number you pass in to see how many blocks you jump.

## Step 9
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.
