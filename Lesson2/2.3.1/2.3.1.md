# Intermediate Coding - Lesson 2 - Activity 5

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
In this activity, we perform some mathematical calculations on a variable to count the number of blocks the player places down. 


## Step 2
Create a Variable named **b** using the ``||VARIABLES:VARIABLES||`` drawer.

## Step 3
If your workspace doesn't already have one, add an ``||PLAYER:on chat command||`` block. 
Change it to respond to the command **countBlocks**.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("countBlocks",function () {
	
})

```

## Step 4
From the ``||PLAYER:PLAYER||`` drawer drag out a say block and place inside the ``||PLAYER:on chat command||`` block.


#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("countBlocks", function () {
    player.say()
})

```
## Step 5
From the ``||TEXT:TEXT||`` drawer drag out a join block and place inside the ``||PLAYER:say||`` block.
In the first section of the join block, type "Blocks Used: ". 
In the second section of the join block, drag in the variable b from the ``||VARIABLES:VARIABLES||`` drawer.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("countBlocks", function () {
    player.say("Blocks Used: " + b)
})


```

## Step 6
From the ``||BLOCKS:BLOCKS||`` drawer drag out an on block placed block. 
Notice the default block is a grass block so it doesn't need to be changed. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("countBlocks", function () {
    player.say("Blocks Used: " + b)
})

blocks.onBlockPlaced(GRASS, function () {
    
})
```

## Step 7
From the ``||VARIABLES:VARIABLES||`` drawer drag out change item by 1 block and place it in the ``||BLOCKS:on block placed||`` block.

Change the variable to the ``||VARIABLES:b||`` variable created earlier.

This will update the value of blocks by 1 every time the player places a grass block.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("countBlocks", function () {
    player.say("Blocks Used: " + b)
})
blocks.onBlockPlaced(GRASS, function () {
    b += 1
})

```



## Step 8

## Step 11
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.
