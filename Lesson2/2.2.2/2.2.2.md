# Intermediate Coding - Lesson 2 - Activity 4

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
In this activity, we will extend the previous activity to allow us to provide 3 values - the x, y and z coordinates to jump to.

## Step 2
Click on the + symbol to the right of the ``||PLAYER:on chat command "jump" Y||`` block.
```template
player.onChat("jump",function (num1) {
	player.teleport(pos(0, num1, 0))
})
```
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("jump",function (num1, num2) {
	player.teleport(pos(0, num1, 0))
})
```
## Step 3
Go to the variables drawer and create a variable named num2. (Remember, due to an issue with MakeCode, we can't rename the arguments in an activity so we are using the default names.)
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("jump",function (num1,num2) {
	player.teleport(pos(0, num1, 0))
})
```

## Step 4
Repeat the process to add a num3 argument. 

We can now pass 3 arguments to this command.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("jump",function (num1, num2, num3) {
	player.teleport(pos(0, num1, 0))
})
```

## Step 5
From the ``||VARIABLES:VARIABLES||`` drawer drag a ``||VARIABLES:num2||`` block to the X position (1st position) of the relative position block in the teleport to block.

Repeat this process for the num3 variable placing it in the Z position (3rd position) of the relative position block.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
player.onChat("jump",function (num1,num2,num3) {
	player.teleport(pos(num2, num1, num3))
})
```

## Step 6
Next, let's test the code.

Click Next for instructions on how to test your code.

## Step 7 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step, click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. When back in the game move to the middle of the island and open the **chat window** by pressing the T key on the keyboard or tapping the chat icon.
3. In the chat window type **jump 2 2 2** and press **Enter** on the keyboard.
4. Notice you have jumped 2 blocks in each axis.
5. Experiment with passing in different values for the X, Y and Z arguments.

## Step 8
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.

## Step 9 @tutorialCompleted
Return to the game and move onto the next non-player character.
