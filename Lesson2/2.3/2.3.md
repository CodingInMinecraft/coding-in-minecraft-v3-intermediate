# Intermediate Coding - Lesson 2.3 - Using variables to count

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
There are times when you might want to perform a mathematical calculation in your Make Code program.

In Minecraft & MakeCode we can perform mathematical sums (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) on number variables by using blocks from the ``||MATH:MATH||`` drawer.

## Step 2 @unplugged
**Performing a mathematical sum**

In the ``||MATH:MATH||`` drawer there are a number of blocks which you can use to perform mathematical sums - addition (``||MATH:0 + 0||``), subtraction (``||MATH:0 - 0||``), multiplication (``||MATH:0 x 0||``) and division (``||MATH:0 ÷ 0||``)

## Step 3 @unplugged
**Performing a mathematical sum**

To use these blocks place them where you would normally place a number variable. On each side of the mathematical operator you can place either a variable or a number to perform a calculation.

In this example the variable lives is reduced by 1 each time the player dies.
