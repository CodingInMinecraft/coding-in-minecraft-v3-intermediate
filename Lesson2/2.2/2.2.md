# Intermediate Coding - Lesson 2 - Using Chat Commands to Change Variables

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
There are times when we might not know the value we want to set a variable to until the game is being played or change the value of a variable during the game. 
For example, you might want to change your score or your name during the game.

When responding to a chat command event, we can add arguments to pass variable values in when running the command.

## Step 2 @unplugged
**Adding arguments to chat commands**

To add an argument to an ``||PLAYER:on chat command||`` block click on the + to the right of the block.

## Step 4 @unplugged
**Adding arguments to chat commands**

To change the name of the variable click on the down arrow and a list of your existing variables will be displayed along with the option to rename.

If you choose an existing variable the value of that variable will be set to the value provided in the chat command.

The variable can be accessed in the same way as any other variable.
