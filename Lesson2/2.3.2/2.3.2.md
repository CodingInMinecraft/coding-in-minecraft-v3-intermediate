# Intermediate Coding - Lesson 2 - Activity 6

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
At the moment if the code only counts when we place down blocks. 

We will create some code to subtract 1 from the ``||VARIABLES:b||`` variable when the player breaks a block.

```template
player.onChat("countBlocks", function () {
    player.say("Blocks Used: " + b)
})
blocks.onBlockPlaced(GRASS, function () {
    b += 1
})
```

## Step 2
From the ``||BLOCKS:BLOCKS||`` drawer drag out an on block broken block. 
Notice the default block is a grass block so it doesn't need to be changed. 
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
blocks.onBlockBroken(GRASS, function () {
	
})
```

## Step 3

Drag out a change b by 1 block from the ``||VARIABLES:VARIABLES||`` drawer. 
Change the 1 to a negative 1 by adding a minus sign in front of the 1.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
blocks.onBlockBroken(GRASS, function () {
    b += -1
})
```


## Step 4
Next, let's test the code.

Click Next for instructions on how to test your code.

## Step 5 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step, click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. Move into the activity zone. Place 4 blocks and then break 3.   


3. Then, press the **T** key on the keyboard to bring up the chat window and type **countBlocks** and press the Enter key.
You should see Blocks Used: 1 on the screen.

## Step 6
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.

## Step 7 @tutorialCompleted
Return to the game and move onto the next non-player character.
