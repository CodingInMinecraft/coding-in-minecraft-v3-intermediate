# Intermediate Coding - Lesson 2.3.2 - Using Variables to count Activity - Performing Subtraction

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
At the moment if you mine a block the count of grass blocks is unchanged.

We will create some code to subtract 1 from the ``||VARIABLES:b||`` variable when we break a grass block.

```template
blocks.onBlockPlaced(GRASS, function () {
    b += 1
})
player.onChat("countblocks", function () {
    player.say("Blocks Used:" + b)
})
```

## Step 2
Drag out an ``||BLOCKS:on block broken||`` block from the ``||BLOCKS:BLOCKS||`` drawer
Leave the block as the default ``||BLOCKS:Grass||`` block
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
blocks.onBlockBroken(GRASS, function () {
	
})

```
## Step 3
Drag a ``||VARIABLES:set b to 0||``  block from the Variables drawer.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
blocks.onBlockBroken(GRASS, function () {
	b = 0
})
```

## Step 4
From the ``||MATH:MATH||`` drawer drag a ``||MATH:0 - 0||`` block and place it on the 0 in the ``||VARIABLES:set b to 0||`` block

From the Variables drawer drag a ``||VARIABLES:b||`` variable and drop it on the first part of the subtraction.

Change the 2nd number in the subtraction  to 1
#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks 
blocks.onBlockBroken(GRASS, function () {
    b = b-1
})
```

## Step 5
Next lets test the code.

Click Next for instructions on how to test your code.

## Step 6 @unplugged
To test your code:

Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. Add some grass blocks to your inventory if you dont already have some and place and break some grass blocks. Keep a count of how many you place and how many you break.

3. Bring up the chat window and type countblocks and press the Enter key - it should display the total number of blocks still placed

## Step 7
Follow the instructions in the previous step to test your code.

When your code works as expected click next to continue.

If it does not work as expected try to fix and test again.
