# Intermediate Coding - Lesson 2.1 - How to use Variables
### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
When we use variables we give the variable a name -
it is important that this name is descriptive and
meaningful - e.g. if you wanted to create a variable to
hold the players age you might name it PlayersAge or
if you wanted to use a variable to store the players
name you might name it PlayerName.

We can then use the variable by setting its value or
retrieving its value.

## Step 2 @unplugged
**Creating a variable**

Variables can be created from the ``||VARIABLES||`` drawer in MakeCode.

## Step 3 @unplugged
**Creating a variable**

To create a variable click on the ``||VARIABLES:Make a Variable...||`` button

## Step 4 @unplugged
**Creating a variable**

Enter a name for your variable and click Ok

## Step 5 @unplugged
**Creating a variable**

Your variable will then appear in the drawer

## Step 6 @unplugged
**Setting the value of a variable**

To set the value of a variable use the ``||VARIABLES:set variable to 0||`` block from the ``||VARIABLES||`` drawer

## Step 7 @unplugged
**Setting the value of a variable**

Variables are by default of type number.

## Step 8 @unplugged
**Setting the value of a variable - Number Variables**

To set the value of a number variable simply change the the number at the end of the set block.

In this example we have created a variable named score and set its value to 0

## Step 9 @unplugged
**Setting the value of a variable - Text Variables**

To change the type of a variable to Text open the ``||TEXT:TEXT||`` drawer and find the empty text block ``||TEXT: " "||``.
(you may need to click on the Advanced button to reveal the Text option)

## Step 10 @unplugged
**Setting the value of a variable - Text Variables**

Drag the empty text block and drop it on top of the 0 number block in the ``||VARIABLES:set variable to 0||`` block.

## Step 11 @unplugged
**Setting the value of a variable - Text Variables**

To change the value of the text click on the ``||TEXT: " "||`` block and type a value.

## Step 12 @unplugged
**Setting the value of a variable - Boolean Variables**

To change the type of a variable to Boolean open the ``||LOGIC:LOGIC||`` drawer and find the ``||LOGIC: true||`` and ``||LOGIC: false||``  blocks

![alt text](https://intermediatev3.codingcredentials.com/Lesson2/2.1/images/11-SetABooleanVariable.jpg?raw=true "Boolean Variables")

## Step 13 @unplugged
**Setting the value of a variable - Boolean Variables**

Drag either a ``||LOGIC: true||`` or ``||LOGIC: false||`` block and drop it on top of the 0 number block in the ``||VARIABLES:set variable to 0||`` block.

## Step 14 @unplugged
**Setting the value of a variable - Position variables**

To change the type of a variable to Position open the ``||POSITIONS:POSITIONS||`` drawer and find the position blocks

![alt text](https://intermediatev3.codingcredentials.com/Lesson2/2.1/images/13-SetAPositionVariable.jpg?raw=true "Position Variables")

## Step 15 @unplugged
There are 2 types of position in Minecraft - relative ``||POSITIONS: ~0 ~0 ~0||`` and world ``||POSITIONS: 0 0 0||`` positions.

A position represents a location in the Minecraft world.

A position is represented by 3 numbers: **x, y, and z**:

- x: East (positive, +x) or West (negative, -x)
- y: up (positive, +y) or down (negative, -y)
- z: South (positive, +z) or North (negative, -z)

The numbers for x, y, and z are the coordinates (a coordinate is also known as a direction or an axis) of the position.

A relative position has **~(tilda)** before each number and is centered on the player's current position: ``||POSITIONS: ~0 ~0 ~0||``.
The position ``||POSITIONS: ~0 ~0 ~0||`` corresponds to the player's feet.

A world position is 3 numbers that are the distances in each direction from the center of the world ``||POSITIONS: 0 0 0||``. 
This is also called an absolute position.
World positions aren't changed by the player's current position. They always stay the same. For example, the position ``||POSITIONS: 20 32 17||`` will always mean the same block in the world, no matter where the player is.

## Step 16 @unplugged 
Drag either a relative or world position block and drop it on top of the 0 number block in the set variable to block.

You can set each of the 3 values for x, y and z accordingly.
